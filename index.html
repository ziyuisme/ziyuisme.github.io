<h2><p>More <sub> about</sub> me!</h2>
<h4>I love to have a wonderful time with my friends, and when I do, I will have a great day! Sometimes I will get into a fight with my friends, which is normal. But, if I do get into a fight, I will have a grumpy day. I love to play LINE PLAY, which is a fun game! There, you can make friends, create your avatar, and many more! Here is a photo of the app!</h4>
