<h2><p>More <sub> about</sub> me!</h2>
<h4>Now, here are things that me likey. I love to have a wonderful time with my friends, and when I do, I will have a goody-goody day! Sometimes I will get into a fighty with my friends, which is normal. But, if I do get into a fight, I will have a grump-grump day. I love to play LINE PLAY, which is a fun game! There, you can make friends, create your avatar, and many more! Here is a photo of the app!</h4>

<h2>Things<sub> that</sub> are<sub> special</sub> to<sub> me</p></h4>
<h4>Here are more things that I likey. (the general things that me likey.) I love my iPad, and my friends. I also love my family. I like my iPad because when I am bored, I can play<sub> LINE PLAY!!</sub> My favorite! Also, I love my friends because they care for me and make me laugh!! I love my family because they care for me, give me love, and they are the best! Oh! and I also love God because He is the creator of this world and He does miracles and is awesome!!</h2>
<h2>Also...</h2>
<h4>Also, there are other things that you should know about me. Ok, I know my grammer is really off right now, but in Ziyu language, there are no such thing as grammer or shifted verb tenses. So... Now on to the things that you should also know to be my friend. First, I will tell you the things that I no likey. I told you about the things I like, now next up is this! First, I dislike sad things, or in my language it's called moody-moody. I no likey because when ever moody-moody comes out, I get moody-moody, and I will have a grump-grump day. Or grumpy day. I also no likey when my iPad gets taken away for a day, or even worse, a week. It gets taken away when I don't listen to my parents and I get a punishment. Sigh. Now, I will "talk about" (my teacher never lets me say this...) the other things about me in school. I go to Pauoa Elementary, and I'm in 5th grade. Soon enough, I'm gonna go to Kuananakoa Middle school and be a 6th grader! Not very exited but oh well. My teacher is called Mrs. Oliveira and she is super nice. Here are a few pictures of Pauoa Elem.</h4>
